# Multi-Factor-Alpha-Risk-Model
Build multiple alpha factors using zipline & alphalens, and combine them. Use PCA and CVXPY to set up a convex portfolio optimization. Using PCA, a risk model is built. The objective function and constraints for the optimization problem are obtained from the risk model. 

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to examine the quant workflow from top to bottom. Start with a hypothesis; Set up a portfolio optimization to minimize risk. 
1. Set up risk model using PCA
2. Build alpha factors and combine them
3. Set up portfolio optimization -- using the constraints from risk model, and the combined alpha vector. 

# Technologies Used
Python -- Zipline, Numpy, Pandas, Alphalens, SciPy

# Features
This project contains a powerful portfolio optimization, ready for deployment.
